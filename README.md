# heart-disease-predictor

Project to develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) leveraging the PyTorch framework for the meticulous analysis of Radio X images, focusing on predicting the likelihood of patients developing cancer. The project was deployed using AWS and azure, with a front-end developed with Flask.

● Demonstrated considerable success as the model achieved an accuracy rate surpassing 83%, underlining its effectiveness in accurate cancer risk assessment.

● Orchestrated the deployment of the application on both AWS and Azure cloud platforms, ensuring accessibility and scalability

● Developed a friendly user interface using Flask and tested with several users the effectiveness of a well designed UI. Incrementing the user engagement by 50%.

● Working on containerizing the final application using Docker, providing a streamlined deployment process and efficient maintenance.

● Currently working on model tuning and making the application more personalized for every user.
